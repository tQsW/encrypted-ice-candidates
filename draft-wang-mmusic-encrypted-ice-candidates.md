--- abstract

WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of
creating peer-to-peer connections. To maximize the probability of a
direct peer-to-peer connection, client private IP addresses can be
included in this candidate collection, but this has privacy implications.
This document describes a way to share local IP addresses with local peers 
without compromising client privacy. During the ICE process, local IP
addresses are encrypted and authenticated using a pre-shared key and 
cipher suite before being put into ICE candidates as hostnames with an
".encrypted" pseudo-top-level domain. Other peers who also have the PSK
are able to decrypt these addresses and use them normally in ICE processing.

Introduction {#problems}
============

The technique detailed in {{MdnsCandidate}} provides a method to share local IP
addresses with other clients without exposing client private IP to applications.
Given the fact that the application may control the signaling servers,
STUN/TURN servers, and even the remote peer implementation, the locality of the
out-of-band mDNS signaling can be considered the sole source of trust between
peers to share local IPs. However, mDNS messages are by default
scoped to local links {{RFC6762}}, and may not be enabled to traverse subnets
in certain networking environments. These environments may experience
frequent failures in mDNS name resolution and significant connectivity
challenges as a result. On the other hand, endpoints in these environments are
typically managed, in such a way that information can be securely pushed and
shared, including a pre-shared key and its associated cipher suite.

This document proposes a complementary solution for managed networks to share
local IP addresses over the signaling channel without compromising client
privacy. Specifically,
addresses are encrypted with pre-shared key (PSK) cipher suites, and encoded as
hostnames with the ".encrypted" pseudo-top-level domain (pseudo-TLD).

WebRTC and WebRTC-compatible endpoints {{Overview}} that receive ICE
candidates with encrypted addresses will authenticate these hostnames in
ciphertext, decrypt them to IP addresses, and perform ICE processing as usual.
In the case where the endpoint is a web application, the WebRTC implementation
will manage this process internally and will not disclose the IP addresses in
plaintext to the application.

Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

Description {#description}
======================

This section uses the concept of ICE agent as defined in {{RFC8445}}.

Pre-Shared Key Cipher Suite {#ciphersuite}
------------------------------------------

ICE agents that implement this proposal pre-share keys for cipher suites
based on symmetric-key algorithms. The mechanism of sharing such information
is outside the scope of this document, but viable mechanisms exist in browsers
today.

The implementation MUST support the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) {{AES}} algorithm and its operation in the
CTR, CBC or GCM mode with message authentication, and SHOULD use the GCM mode
whenever it is supported. The implementation MUST pre-determine a single mode
to use as part of the mechanism to share the information about the cipher suite.
When using the CTR or CBC mode, HMAC with SHA-2 MUST be supported.

Since the plaintext to encrypt consists of only a single IPv4 or IPv6 address
that fits in a single 128-bit block, the initialization parameter for each mode
can be a cryptographically random number. In particular, this parameter is given
by a 16-byte initial counter block value for CTR, or a 16-byte or 12-byte
initialization vector for CBC or GCM, respectively.

Note the ICE password associated with an ICE agent has at least 128-bit
randomness as defined by {{RFC8445}}. To reduce the overhead in the candidate
encoding that will be detailed in the next section, the initialization parameter
MUST be chosen as the first 16 bytes or 12 bytes in the network order for the
mode in use.

ICE Candidate Gathering {#gathering}
------------------------------------

This section outlines how a PSK cipher suite should be used by ICE agents to
conceal local IP addresses.

### Procedure

For each host candidate gathered by an ICE agent as part of the gathering
process described in {{RFC8445}}, Section 5.1.1, the candidate is handled as
described below.

1. Check whether the IP address satisfies the ICE agentâ€™s policy regarding
   whether an address is safe to expose. If so, expose the candidate and abort
   this process.

2. Generate the encrypted address.
   1. Let *address* be the IP address of the candidate, and embed it as an IPv6
      address if it is an IPv4 address, using the "Well-Known Prefix" as
      described in {{RFC6052}}.
   2. Let *ciphersuite* be the pre-determined cipher suite and its
      initialization parameter, and *key* the PSK.
   3. Let *EncryptAndAuthenticate(plaintext, ciphersuite, key)* be an operation
      that uses the given cipher suite to encrypt a given plaintext with
      authentication, and returns concatenated ciphertext and message
      authentication code (MAC).
   4. Compute *encrypted_address* as the output of
      *EncryptAndAuthenticate(address, ciphersuite, key)*.

3. Generate a pseudo-FQDN as follows.
   1. Encode *encrypted_address* to a hex string, and split the hex string
      to substrings after every 32 characters.
   2. Form a string by joining the substrings above sequentially with the
      delimiter ".". Denote the formed string by *encoded_encrytped_address*.
   3. Generate the pseudo-FQDN "*encoded_encrypted_address.encrypted*" with
      the pseudo-TLD "*.encrypted*".

4. Replace the IP address of the ICE candidate with the pseudo-FQDN from step 3,
   and provide the candidate to the application.

### Example

The candidate attribute in an SDP message to exchange the encrypted candidate
can be given by

  a=candidate:1 1 udp 2122262783
    8c9bd03bb7a5a76a5803eebc688f0388.fa991acbdf116f6b72fd3a781174cd58.encrypted
    56622 typ host

following the above procedure. This example assumes the use of the GCM mode, in
which case the 256-bit *encrypted_address* consists of 128-bit ciphertext and
128-bit MAC, and can be encoded to 64 hex characters as two labels.

ICE Candidate Processing {#processing}
-------------------------------------

This section outlines how received ICE candidates with encrypted addresses are
processed by ICE agents, and is relevant to all endpoints.

For any remote ICE candidate received by the ICE agent, the following procedure
is used.

1. If the connection-address field value of the ICE candidate does not end with
   ".encrypted", then process the candidate as defined in {{RFC8445}} or
   {{MdnsCandidate}}.

2. If the ICE agent has no PSK cipher suite for encrypted candidates,
   proceed to step 5.

3. Decrypt the address as follows.
   1. Let *AuthenticateAndDecrypt(ciphertext_and_mac, ciphersuite, key)* be an
      operation using the given cipher suite to authenticate and decrypt a given
      ciphertext with MAC, and returns the decrypted value, or an
      fail-to-decrypt (FTD) error.
   2. Let *encoded_encrypted_address* be the value of the connection-address
      field after removing the trailing "*.encrypted*", and let *encrypted_address*
      be the string after removing all "." in *encoded_encrypted_address*.
   3. Let *decrypted_address* be given by
      *AuthenticateAndDecrypt(encrypted_address)*. If *decrypted_address* does
      not represent a valid IPv6 address or an embedded IPv4 address, or an FTD
      error is raised, proceed to step 5.
   4. Convert *decrypted_address* to an IPv4 address if it is embedded.

4. Replace the connection-address field of the ICE candidate with
   *decrypted_address*, skip the rest steps and continue processing of the
   candidate as described in {{RFC8445}}.

5. Discard the candidate, or proceed to step 6 if the ICE agent implements
   {{MdnsCandidate}}.

6. Let *encoded_encrypted_address* be the same value as defined in step 3.
   Construct an mDNS name given by "*encoded_encrypted_address.local*", and
   proceed to step 2 in Section 3.2.1 in {{MdnsCandidate}}.

ICE agents can implement this procedure in any way as long as it produces
equivalent results.

Security Considerations {#security}
=======================

mDNS Message Flooding via Fallback Resolution
--------------------------------------------

Encrypted candidates can be spoofed and signaled to an ICE agent to trigger the
fallback mDNS resolution as described in step 6 in {{processing}}. This can
potentially generate excessive traffic in the subnet. Note however that
implementations of {{MdnsCandidate}} are required to have a proper rate
limiting scheme of mDNS messages.

IANA Considerations
===================

This document requires no actions from IANA.
